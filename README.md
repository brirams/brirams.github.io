# brirams.github.io

Source for my bare bones personal site. It's built using jekyll, using
[a theme that I forked](https://github.com/brirams/grayscale-theme) to get some bootstrap
niceties. I started out by keeping the two repos separate and making changes to the forked theme and
then pulling them into this one and that proved to be a real pain. I learned pretty late in the
game that I could override `_includes` files in that repo but redefining them in this repo and that
made the ergonomics of making edits and overrides a lot better, at the expense of some copy
pasta. _sigh_

In any case, I might just merge the two at some point but it's at least up and running and I'm
pretty stoked on how simple it turned out.
