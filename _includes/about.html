                <p>Software engineer with over a decade of experience working on backend systems for everything from investment banks to social media companies, both large and small. Currently hacking on databases as <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>.</p>
                <p>You'll no doubt notice how plain and simple this site is: it's an experiment with Jekyll and github pages and it's pretty neat so far. I might write about it some day but in the meantime, shout out to <a href="https://github.com/jeromelachaud">Jerome Lachaud</a> for the sweet theme and <a href="http://gratisography.com/">Gratisography</a> for the photos.
